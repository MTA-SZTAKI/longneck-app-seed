              QUICKSTART for Longneck

This you need before you can run this application:

 - Apache Maven, above 3.0.x (http://maven.apache.org/).
   It's useful to have the 'mvn' executable in your PATH!

After you have all the above prerequisites, run:

    $ mvn install

This will:
 - download all needed dependencies into templates/lib/;
 - build your application;
 - the executable scripts shall be created in bin/

Now you can do:

    bin/<project-name> -p processes/your-process.xml

This will run the process defined in "processes/your-process.xml".

See http://longneck.sztaki.hu for more details.

Have fun!
